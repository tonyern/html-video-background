# About
HTML page with a video covering the whole page. In this project, there is video that autoplays and loops. 
On the bottom of the page, there is a video content area with a header, paragraph and button.
That button controls the playing or pausing of the video. The button text changes as well depending on state of the video.

# Implementation
Coded in Visual Studio Code. HTML used as a markup to placed video with its content. Bootstrap was used to set the layout. 
Functionality was coded in TypeScript and then complied into JavaScript for a safer development.
